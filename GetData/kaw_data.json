Due to his dominant position in Italian politics, critics often refer to him as Re Giorgio (\"King George\"). He is the longest serving President in the history of the modern Italian Republic, existent from 1946.Although the presidency is a nonpartisan office as guarantor of Italy's Constitution, Napolitano was a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party (and of its post-Communist successors, from the Democratic Party of the Left onwards). He was a leading member of a modernizing faction on the right of the party. First elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life, and was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 1994. He was Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 under Romano Prodi.Napolitano was appointed a Senator for life in 2005 by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In May 2006, he was elected by parliament as President of Italy. During his first term of office, he oversaw governments both of the centre-left, led by Prodi, and the centre-right, led by Silvio Berlusconi. In November 2011, Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister amid financial and economic problems.  Napolitano, in keeping with his constitutional role, then asked former EU commissioner Mario Monti to form  a cabinet of unelected professionals, which became widely referred to as a \"government of the president\".When his seven-year presidential term expired in April 2013, Napolitano (then aged 87) reluctantly agreed to stand again, to safeguard the continuity of the country's institutions during the parliamentary deadlock that followed the 2013 general election. On being reelected as President with broad cross-party support in parliament, he overcame the impasse by inviting Enrico Letta to propose a government in the form of a grand coalition. When Letta handed in his resignation on 14 February 2014, Napolitano mandated Matteo Renzi (Letta's factional challenger) to form a new government. After a record eight and a half years as president, Napolitano resigned at age 89 in January 2015.","type46":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ItalianMinistersOfTheInterior","type54":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PresidentsOfItaly","type36":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SkilledWorker110605985"},{"type39":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/ItalianAtheists","type32":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Reformer110515194","type37":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Female109619168","type26":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Militant110315837","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_1566","comment9":"Emma Bonino (born 9 March 1948 in Bra) is an Italian politician, who most recently served as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

His progression in the late 1980s is known as the \"Lep\u00e9nisation des esprits\" or lep\u00e9nisation of spirits due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. Lepenism in France refers to his eurosceptic, nationalist and conservative ideas. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure that polarizes opinion, considered as the \"Devil of the Republic\" among his opponents or as the last samurai in politics among his supporters. His progress to the second round in the 21 April 2002 presidential election left its mark on French public life, and the \"21st of April\" is now a frequently used expression in France. Since the \"de-demonization of the Front national\" by Marine Le Pen, his daughter and successor, he is more absent in public life but still active at a lower level. A June 2014 poll showed that 91% of the French have a bad opinion of him.Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. He advocates immigration restrictions, the death penalty, raising incentives for homemakers, and euroscepticism. He strongly opposes same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and abortion.","type46":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleConvictedOfHolocaustDenialOffenses","type36":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553"},{"comment5":"Alain Madelin  (born 26 March 1946, in Paris) is a French politician and a former minister of that country.Madelin, a strong supporter of laissez-faire economics, was a candidate in the 2002 French presidential election as the leader of the D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale party, where he scored 3.91% on the first round.","type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_1024","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/FrenchPoliticians","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alain_Madelin","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","type22":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromParis","type3":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Agent","type13":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","abstract":"Alain Madelin  (born 26 March 1946, in Paris) is a French politician and a former minister of that country.Madelin, a strong supporter of laissez-faire economics, was a candidate in the 2002 French presidential election as the leader of the D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale party, where he scored 3.91% on the first round. Following the election, he became a member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).He was minister of Industry in Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's cabinet from 1986 to 1988, a minister of Business in Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur's cabinet from 1993 to 1995, and a minister of Economy and Finances in Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9's cabinet. He resigned after only four months, citing economic policy differences with Alain Jupp\u00e9.He was a member of the National Assembly from 1978 to 2007 as representative for Ille-et-Vilaine's fourth circumscription. The district includes the town of Redon, where he was mayor from 1995 until 2001.Madelin unsuccessfully ran in 1996 for president of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), and was defeated by Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9otard. He was elected as leader of the Parti R\u00e9publicain, a part of the UDF coalition, which he renamed D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale. In 1998, D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale split from the UDF. Madelin's obtained slightly less than 4% of the vote in the 2002 presidential election and merged his party into the UMP. After 2002, although his former supporter Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime minister, and as a result of the end of D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale, Madelin's influence in French national politics dwindled.Madelin is the French major politician the most in favor of the international policies of the United States, and supported the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because of this, he has, in the past, generally been considered with favor by the US press.In July 2005, Alain Madelin rumors reported in the Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 stated that he would run for the OCDE  and that he would be supported by both Jacques Chirac (who allegedly wanted to get rid of him) and George W. Bush (since Madelin is traditionally France's important politician closest to the United States). He did not run and Angel Gurria of Mexico was chosen.Alain Madelin did not seek reelection in the 2007 elections, ending his involvement in partisan politics.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/RepublicanParty(France)Politicians","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LiberalDemocracy(France)Politicians","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","name":"Alain Madelin","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"comment3":"Jean-Louis Bourlanges (born July 13, 1946 in Neuilly) was a French Member of the European Parliament from 1989 to 2007.

She was a Member of the European Parliament for the Conservative Party from 1984 to 2009.Before she became an MEP, Jackson was a Research Fellow at St.Hugh's College Oxford, where she obtained a doctorate in 19th century political history. She worked at the Conservative Research Department from 1973 to 1974 and fought the constituency of Birmingham Erdington in the February 1974 General Election. She then became a member of the research team supporting the first British Conservative MEPs from 1974 -1984.She was elected to represent the Wiltshire constituency from 1984 to 1994, then the new Wiltshire North and Bath from 1994 to 1999 and from 1999 to 2009 served as an MEP for the South West England constituency.In the European Parliament, she was a leading member of the Environment Committee and between 1999 and 2004 was Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Consumer Protection and Public Health. During her chairmanship she tried to focus attention as much on Member States' performance in transposing and applying new EU laws as on the adoption of more such laws. This was during a period of very intense legislation in the area of water and air pollution, waste disposal and controls on chemicals. Jackson controlled the committee firmly but with humour \u2013 qualities very necessary when German opponents of new laws on alternative medicines attempted to control proceedings in 1995. It was noted that on 11 September 2001 Jackson's committee was the only one that did not adjourn when the news of the attacks on New York came through: Jackson argued that abrupt abandonment of the Committee's work would have been another small victory for the terrorists. Jackson has been described by Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies thus: \"She's been here forever: a bit 'jolly hockey sticks' but firm, fair and funny.\" Jackson specialised, as parliamentary rapporteur, on waste legislation. She took the Landfill Directive through the Parliament in 1997-8. In 2008 she was rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. Initially criticised as being too close to the waste industry lobby, Jackson managed to unite most of her opponents in support of an ambitious final text which the Council of Ministers only agreed with reluctance. This placed an obligation on Member States to achieve recycling rates of 50% by 2020, created for the Commission the possibility of putting in place waste reduction targets and cleared up the question of the status of incineration of waste as a form of \"recovery\" rather than \"disposal\".Jackson believed that David Cameron was wrong to direct the Conservative MEPs to leave the European People's Party in 2009 because this meant a huge loss of political influence. She pointed out that the Conservatives had in fact enjoyed a high level of political independence within the EPP. She argued that the Conservatives' new position from 2009 in the \"Conservatives and European Reformists group\" with the Czech ODS party, the Polish Law and Justice party and a motley crew of European rightists, would mean that they would lose influence and visibility in the European Parliament at precisely the moment when the Parliament's powers were increasing. She made her views known in press articles in 2009 and Cameron feared that she might follow her  husband, Robert V. Jackson, MP for Wantage (1983-2005) in abandoning the Conservative party for the Labour Party.

He was a Member of Parliament, holding a seat for the Liberal Party from 1976 to 1979, and for the Green Party from 1988 to 1991, and again in 1994-95. Later, he was a Member of the European Parliament from 1995 to 2004. Early in his career, Gahrton was elected chairman of the youth and student wing of the Swedish Liberal Party, in 1969. In 1971 he was challenged for the post by Lars Leijonborg due to ideological tensions; Leijonborg succeeded him after a narrow win. Gahrton entered in 1976 as a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in 1979 but left the parliament and the party the same year, expressing disenchantment with the parliament bureaucracy. Turning to the nascent Green Party, in the 1980s he was one of its founders in 1981 and one of its more high-profile men for many years, one of relatively few in the new party who had several years of prior experience of professional politics before joining; he served as one of two spokespersons for the party from 1984 to 1985. He also served as a Member of Parliament for the Green Party from 1988 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 2004 he was a Member of the European Parliament. He is an outspoken eurosceptic and was one of the leading proponents of the \"no\"-side in the 1994 Swedish European Union membership referendum (which was won by the \"yes\"-side).Gahrton currently serves as Presidentof the Swedish Association for Solidarity with Palestine.In December 2008, Gahrton sharply criticized the a European Union proposal \u201dGuidelines for strengthening the political dialogue structures with Israel\u201d arguing that the guidelines in fact were meant to establish \"a Security Pact with Israel.\" He also argued that due to \"the well-known Israeli skill in lobbying and in influencing opinions worldwide, it is no exaggeration to argue that from now on and for all practical purposes the Middle East Policy of the EU will be elaborated, even co-written, by Israel.\" In March 2009, Gahrton participated in a large protest against the Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel in Malmo. Under orders from local politicians, the match was played behind closed doors. Gahrton claimed that this decision had already given demonstrators some success, stating that \"We have been helped by brave politicians in Malm\u00f6. We thank them for that.\"Gahrton is the author of \"Life and Death in the European Parliament\", part political thriller, part tell-all memoir. The book was criticized by fellow parliament members as being a thinly disguised rip-off of Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\", which dominated Sweden's best seller lists at the time, and Gahrton accused of wanting to cash in on Brown's success. Consequently, Gahrton was forced to distribute the book free of charge.Gahrton has described himself as Jewish according to the traditional Jewish definition, as his matrilineal family, viz. his maternal grandmother's mother, was Jewish.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Communicator109610660","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Writer110794014","name":"Per Gahrton","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SwedishNovelists","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromMalm%C3%B6"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2123","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenys_Kinnock","name":"Glenys Kinnock"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2125","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pat_The_Cope_Gallagher","name":"Pat The Cope Gallagher"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2128","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paavo_Vayrynen","name":"Paavo V\u00c4Yrynen"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2130","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_Lalumiere","name":"Catherine Lalumi\u00c8Re"},{"type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2149","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Woman110787470","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maj_Britt_Theorin","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","type22":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","comment1":"Karin Maj Britt Margareta Theorin (born December 22, 1932, G\u00f6teborg), commonly known as Maj Britt Theorin, is a Swedish social democratic politician and diplomat.

He was a member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Booth was born in Paignton, Devon and educated at Torquay Boys' Grammar School. Before he entered politics, he was a businessman in the building and tourism trades. In the 1999 European Parliament elections, Booth was the number two candidate on the UKIP list for South West England.  Consequently he became an MEP in 2002 as the replacement for Michael Holmes, former party leader, when Holmes resigned from the European Parliament. Booth was re-elected in 2004 with a greatly increased vote. In the 2005 General Election he contested the Torbay constituency in Devon, and gained 7.9% of the vote.UKIP MEPs frequently claim that the European Parliament is a powerless talking shop, with real lawmaking power resting with the European Commission. However, Graham Booth is credited with having helped save the Isles of Scilly helicopter shuttle service in his constituency by means of an astute parliamentary speech in 2003. The service, which is crucial to life on the islands, had been threatened with closure by a heavy-handed interpretation of a new EU directive aimed at larger airlines. Following Booth's speech, an alliance between UKIP and the UK Labour Party MEPs persuaded the EU Transport Commissioner to amend the directive, allowing the service (and similar 'social carriers' across Europe) to continue in business.Booth retired from his role as a UKIP MEP on 1 October 2008 and was replaced by the next candidate on the list, Trevor Colman. He continued to be a keen activist in and around the bay until his death in December 2011.","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://schema.org/Person","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromPaignton","name":"Graham Booth","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"comment3":"Joost Lagendijk (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8jo\u02d0st \u02c8la\u02d0\u0263\u0259(n)\u02ccd\u025bi\u032fk]; born June 8, 1957 in Roosendaal, Netherlands) is a columnist with the Turkish dailies Zaman and Today's Zaman.

In the spring 1999, the Finnish MEP Sirkka-Liisa Anttila opted to resign three months before her term was up to accept a position in the Parliament of Finland. Pohjamo, having been second runner-up in the previous election (Olli Rehn, the first Centre Party runner-up, declined), became a member for the brief period until the next election, the following summer.In the 1999 European Parliament elections, Pohjamo was re-elected with a 25,000 votes, most of them coming from his home region in Oulu. During his five-year term he served as a member of the Committee on Regional Development.In the 2004 election, Pohjamo increased his tally of votes to 27,490, but his lack of nation-wide support (only 3,000 of those votes came from outside the Oulu electoral district) caused him to fall short of the mark, becoming his party's first runner-up. When fellow Centre Party representative Paavo V\u00e4yrynen resigned his membership in the European Parliament to move into the position of Finland's Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Pohjamo was once again raised from the position of runner-up into a parliament member.Samuli Pohjamo has been an editor-in-chief in Suomenmaa.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type7":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q82955","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://schema.org/Person","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CentreParty(Finland)Politicians","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","name":"Samuli Pohjamo","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"type8":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/OfficeHolder","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Officeholder110371450","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SkilledWorker110605985","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_2341","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Gahler","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","comment4":"Michael Gahler (born April 22, 1960 Frankfurt/Main) is a German politician and Member of the European Parliament for Hesse.

He was educated at St Kierans College, Kilkenny. He worked as a laboratory technician before getting involved in politics. He was elected to Kilkenny County Council in 1974, serving on that authority until 1992.  Aylward was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD for the Carlow\u2013Kilkenny constituency at the 1977 general election in what proved to be a landslide for Fianna F\u00e1il. Since then he has served as Minister of State at the Department of Energy (1988\u20131989), at the Department of Education (1992\u20131994) and at the Department of Agriculture and Food (2002\u20132004). In 1998 Aylward was the subject of a complaint to Oireachtas authorities for groping a female usher in the dail bar for which he apologised. In 2004 he was elected to the European Parliament in the East constituency for Fianna F\u00e1il, which was then part of the Union for a Europe of Nations. Since the 2009 European Parliament election, Fianna F\u00e1il is affiliated with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Aylward is a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the delegation for relations with Mercosur and the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly. Aylward is also a substitute member of the Committee on Culture and Education and the delegation to the ACP\u2013EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Because dual mandate legislation forbids Members of the European Parliament from seeking re-election as members of their national legislatures, Liam Aylward retired from national politics at the 2007 general election. He was succeeded as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD by his brother, Bobby Aylward. He is the son of the Bob Aylward who served as a Fianna F\u00e1il senator.Aylward has opted not to receive a ministerial pension but still receives annual pension payments of around \u20ac50,000 from his time as a TD.He retired from politics at the 2014 European Parliament election.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://schema.org/Person","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Associate109816771","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Peer109626238","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncilMember109944763","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","name":"Liam Aylward","type30":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LocalCouncillorsInCountyKilkenny","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/FiannaF%C3%A1ilPoliticians","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Worker109632518","type31":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Officeholder110371450"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_28115","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mairead_Mcguinness","name":"Mairead Mcguinness"},{"type26":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type32":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromCountySligo","type8":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/OfficeHolder","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SkilledWorker110605985","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_28116","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Official110372373","type28":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/IndependentPoliticiansInIreland","type33":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marian_Harkin","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","type29":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","type22":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Scholar110557854","comment1":"Marian Harkin (born 26 November 1953) is an Irish politician and a member of the European Democratic Party.

Dehaene's first government (1992\u20131995) included both Christian and Social Democrats and presided over the creation of a new constitution, effectively transforming Belgium into a federal state. His second government (1995\u20131999) coincided with a number of crises in Belgium including the Dutroux scandal. The Dioxin Affair, occurring shortly before the 1999 election, led to a swing against the major parties and Dehaene's government fell. Following his final term as Prime Minister he was active in both Belgian and European politics. He was also on UEFA's financial fair play regulatory body and managed Dexia Bank during the financial crisis. Dehaene holds the distinction of being the last prime minister of King Baudouin's reign.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/Politician","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Official110372373","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Administrator109770949","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Executive110069645","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://umbel.org/umbel/rc/PrimeMinister_HeadOfGovernment","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BelgianMinistersOfState","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Minister110320863","name":"Jean-Luc Dehaene","type30":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Worker109632518","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SkilledWorker110605985","type31":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople"},{"type8":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_28257","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivo_Belet","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","comment4":"Ivo Maria Robert Belet (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8ivo\u02d0 b\u0259\u02c8l\u025bt]; born on 7 June 1959 in Sint-Truiden),is a Belgian politician andMember of the European Parliament for Flanderswith the CD&V,part of the European People's Party, and sits onthe European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

He is known for his strongly anti-ETA views. Grandson of Marcelino Oreja El\u00f3segui, the ultraconservative Carlist politician.He graduated in agronomic engineering. In 1977 he joined the Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico (UCD) and from 1979 to 1982 represented Guip\u00fazcoa in the Spanish Parliament. On 9 March 1980 he was elected  Member of the Basque Parliament. On 30 July 1982 he was appointed as the Government's Delegate in the Basque Country by the then President Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo. On 16 October a grenade was unsuccessfully thrown against his office window, and he was not hurt. On 29 December the new Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez removed him from office. In February 1983 the UCD disbanded and he joined \u00d3scar Alzaga's Democratic Popular Party. On 26 February 1984 he stood for the position of Basque President for the Democratic Coalition, but failed to win. The coalition collapsed after the general elections of June 1986. He then tried to create another party within the Basque Country but was unable to generate enough interest until in March 1987 he founded a new party, Union of the Basque People (UPV). In 1989 he joined the newly formed People's Party and was elected  Deputy in the Congress of Deputies for Vizcaya, although he also represented Alava on separate occasions. At the tenth Party Congress on 31 March 1990 he was elected to the National Executive of the People's Party as the president of the Basque section. After the Peoples's party victory in the 1996 General Elections he was sworn in as Minister of the Interior on 6 May 1996 along with the other members of the new PP government, a post in which he remained until April 2001. In May 2001 he unsuccessfully ran for the Basque presidency again, coming second against incumbent Juan Jose Ibarretxe. Upon being defeated, he was briefly the People's Party parliamentary leader in the Basque Parliament. During his tenure in the Basque Parliament, he famously failed to be present in key debates such as the 2002 budget debate; without his vote, the opposition failed to secure enough votes to overturn the budget, which enabled Ibarretxe's minority government to successfully pass it by simple majority. He resigned his seat in 2004 to lead the People's Party list for the 2004 European Parliament Election and was elected. During his tenure in the European Parliament, he kept a low profile, being one of the least active MEPs during the 2004-2014 decade. He positioned himself as one of the visible leaders of the People's Party right wing faction, and one of the party's hard-liners against Basque terrorism. In January 2014 he announced he would not be running again for the European Parliament due to public disagreements with prime minister Mariano Rajoy's government's policies towards ETA, the basque terrorist group. Since then, he has joined FAES, the People's Party think-tank.","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BasquePoliticians","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/People'sParty(Spain)Politicians","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","name":"Jaime Mayor Oreja","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_28363","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/DemocraticParty(Italy)Politicians","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfonso_Andria","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","type22":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","comment1":"Alfonso Andria (born on 27 May 1952 in Salerno)is an Italian politician andMember of the European Parliamentfor Southernwith the Margherita Party,part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and sits onthe European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development.He is a substitute for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States and a substitute for the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.","type3":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Agent","type13":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","abstract":"Alfonso Andria (born on 27 May 1952 in Salerno)is an Italian politician andMember of the European Parliamentfor Southernwith the Margherita Party,part of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and sits onthe European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development.He is a substitute for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States and a substitute for the Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromSalerno","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","name":"Alfonso Andria","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_28365","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromTheProvinceOfCremona","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pier_Antonio_Panzeri","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","comment2":"Pier Antonio Panzeri (born 6 June 1955) is an Italian politician and Member of the European Parliament for the North-West with the Democrats of the Left (DS), part of the Socialist Group and sits on the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.He is a substitute for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

She is a member of the Democratic Party (DP).Polfer succeeded her father, Camille Polfer, as mayor of Luxembourg City, when he was forced to resign from the position due to poor health after only two years.  She was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1984 election, representing Centre.  She was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the government of Jean-Claude Juncker from August 1999 until July 2004.In the 2004 legislative election, Polfer was elected, once again, top of the DP list, coming second overall to Luc Frieden.  However, the DP polled poorly overall, losing five seats nationwide, and, with them, their position as the second-largest party and kingmakers.  As such, the CSV entered instead into a coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP), ejecting Polfer from the government.  The European Parliament election held on the same day also saw the DP lose votes, as well as fall to fourth, behind the Greens for the first time.  Nonetheless, Polfer still came top of the DP list (and third overall), and took her place in the European Parliament, where the DP sit in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.She is now Mayor of Luxembourg City, after being mayor there from 1982 to 1999.

Schori was appointed election supervisor in Zimbabwe 2002 by the European Union. He was also suggested as the United Nations' administrator for Kosovo, but never became one after protests from the United States. They objected to Schori's prior support for Fidel Castro and other socialist regimes. Schori responded by accusing the Bush administration of \"McCarthyism\" [1].Since March 2007 Schori has been General Director of FRIDE, a think-tank based in Madrid.Schori is sympathetically portrayed as Peter Sorman in the fellow 1968-radical Jan Guillou's Hamilton novels, with a clearly anti-imperialist attitude, at least as critical against the United States as against China or the Soviet Union.

He currently is the honorary Chairman of the Left Party.Modrow was born in Jasenitz, Province of Pomerania, Germany, now Jasienica  part of the town of Police, Poland. He briefly served in the Volkssturm, founded in 1944 by Adolf Hitler and was subsequently held as a prisoner of war. Upon release in 1949, he joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED).  Modrow had a long political career in East Germany, including periods as a member of the Volkskammer. From 1973 onward, he was the SED leader in Dresden, East Germany's third-largest city.  Modrow was widely reckoned as one of the few truly competent leaders in the East German hierarchy.  He was prevented from rising any further than a local party boss, however, largely because he was one of the few SED leaders who dared to publicly criticise longtime SED chief Erich Honecker.  Nonetheless, he developed some important contacts with the Soviet Union, including eventual Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  When Honecker was toppled in October 1989, Gorbachev hoped that Modrow would become the new leader of the SED.  However, Egon Krenz was selected instead.He became premier following the resignation of Willi Stoph on 18 November 1989.  After Krenz's resignation as leader of the SED on 3 December, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany.  The SED, which later changed its name to the Party of Democratic Socialism, had abandoned power two days earlier.  Modrow remained premier until the elections on 18 March 1990.After the German reunification, Modrow served as a member of the European Parliament (1999\u20132004) and of the Bundestag.In 1993 the German Federal Court found Modrow guilty of electoral fraud committed in the Dresden municipal elections in May 1989, specifically, understating the percentage of voters who refused to vote for the official slate.  (East Germany did not hold free elections until March 1990, and the outcome of any given election was never in doubt.)  The judge declined to impose a prison sentence or a fine. However, the court revoked its decision in 1995 and Modrow was sentenced to nine years on probation.  Modrow did not directly deny the charges, but argued that the trial was politically motivated and that the court lacked jurisdiction for crimes committed in East Germany.  \"We were all members of a political system,\" he said, speaking to the court in Dresden.  \"Some perhaps had the good fortune not to come into contact with manipulation, while others could not or were not allowed to turn away.\"","type36":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PrimeMinistersOfEastGermany"},{"comment3":"Feleknas Uca (born 17 September 1976) is a German Die Linke politician of Kurdish ancestry.

She lost her seat at the 1989 general election but was re-elected at the 1992 general election, again losing her seat at the 1997 general election to party colleague Michael D'Arcy. She was a member of the Seanad from 1989\u20131992 and from 1997\u20132002. She was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) at the 1999 election and re-elected at the 2004 election. She served as a Minister of State in the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition governments of 1982\u201387 and 1994\u201397.Doyle made news during debate in the European Parliament in June 2008 after the rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon by Irish voters. A group of British Eurosceptic MEPs wore green hats and T-shirts, encouraging the EU to respect the Irish 'no' vote. However, many Irish MEPs saw this as self-serving and felt that there would be no Eurosceptic support for Irish opinion had the treaty been accepted; and Doyle was both lauded and criticised for the following comment, which is a reference to the forceful occupation of Ireland by Britain; \"How the history books could have been written differently, if respect for the Irish vote from some of our British colleagues was always there.\"She announced on 7 January 2009 that she would not be seeking re-election to the European Parliament at the 2009 election.On 21 June 2011 she announced her intention to seek the Fine Gael party nomination to run for President of Ireland. She withdrew from the nomination process in October 2011.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://schema.org/Person","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Associate109816771","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Peer109626238","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncilMember109944763","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","name":"Avril Doyle","type30":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LocalCouncillorsInCountyWexford","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/FineGaelPoliticians","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Worker109632518","type31":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Officeholder110371450"},{"comment5":"Alain Lipietz (born September 19, 1947 in Charenton-le-Pont as Alain Guy Lipiec) is a French engineer, economist and politician, a former Member of the European Parliament, and a member of the French Green Party.

He subsequently claimed that he had been treated differently from other Conservative MEPs in similar positions, ascribing this to racist elements within the party.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Migrant110314952","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://schema.org/Person","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Traveler109629752","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AlumniOfTheUniversityOfOxford","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Emigrant110051975","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/AlumniOfTheSchoolOfPharmacy,UniversityOfLondon","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Scholar110557854","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Alumnus109786338","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","name":"Bashir Khanbhai","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930"},{"type26":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Worker109632518","dboAlmaMater1":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sherborne_School","type32":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/OfficersOfTheOrderOfTheBritishEmpire","type34":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","comment3":"Andrew Nicholas Duff, OBE (born 25 December 1950) is a Liberal Democrat politician, president of the Union of European Federalists, and a former Member of the European Parliament for the East of England region of the UK.","type8":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Serviceman110582746","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MilitaryOfficer110317007","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_4514","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type28":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncillorsInCambridgeshire","type33":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromBirkenhead","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Duff","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Member110307234","type0":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing","type29":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type22":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","type3":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Agent","dboAlmaMater0":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_John's_College,_Cambridge","type13":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncilMember109944763","abstract":"Andrew Nicholas Duff, OBE (born 25 December 1950) is a Liberal Democrat politician, president of the Union of European Federalists, and a former Member of the European Parliament for the East of England region of the UK.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/SkilledWorker110605985","type7":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q82955","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Associate109816771","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Leader109623038","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://schema.org/Person","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Peer109626238","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","name":"Andrew Duff","type30":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LiberalDemocrat(UK)Councillors","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type31":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople"},{"type26":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromColchester(district)","comment3":"Jeffrey William Titford (born 24 October 1933, West Mersea, Essex) is a British politician who served as leader of the UK Independence Party from 2000 until 2002.

He served again as interim leader in September to November 2010 following the resignation of Lord Pearson of Rannoch. He was also a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England from 1999 to 2009. He had been at various times a member of the Conservative Party (for whom he was a local councillor), the New Britain Party and the Referendum Party.  He was the most successful Referendum Party candidate in the 1997 general election, winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in Harwich.  However, later that year he joined the UKIP. In 1999, Titford became one of the first UKIP representatives to win a seat in the European Parliament. In 2000, UKIP's then leader, Michael Holmes, MEP, resigned amidst serious infighting. Jeffrey Titford narrowly won the ensuing leadership election, promising to reunite the party and restore its effectiveness as a campaigning organisation. This he largely succeeded in doing. The Guardian newspaper described him in 2001 as \"an emollient man, a sort of Willie Whitelaw figure, and an ideal leader for such a fractious party\". He led UKIP into the 2001 general election, in which it stood more than 420 candidates but failed to make any breakthroughs (although it did consolidate its position as the largest of the smaller parties). In October 2002, Titford stepped down as party leader to allow his successor time to lay out his strategy for the 2004 European Election. He also wanted to spend more time on political campaigns in the East of England, where he continued to be an active MEP. He was re-elected with a greatly increased share of the vote in the 2004 European elections. At this election, UKIP also returned a second MEP, Tom Wise.At the 2005 general election, Titford again contested Harwich. He came fourth of six candidates and polled 2,314 votes, a share of 4.6%, losing his deposit. Titford stepped down from the European Parliament at the 2009 European Parliament Election. He and Wise were succeeded as UKIP MEPs for the East of England by David Campbell-Bannerman and Stuart Agnew.Titford is regarded by many in UKIP as the nearest the party has to an elder statesman. In October 2005, UKIP's leader Roger Knapman announced that he was appointing Titford as party chairman for an interim period.Before entering politics he was a businessman. He was president of the National Association of Funeral Directors.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LeadersOfTheUnitedKingdomIndependenceParty","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://schema.org/Person","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Anti-globalistActivists","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Reformer110515194","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Disputant109615465","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Politician110451263","name":"Jeffrey Titford","type27":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person","type25":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople"},{"type26":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Worker109632518","type32":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleEducatedAtKingEdwardVISchool,Southampton","type8":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/OfficeHolder","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Scholar110557854","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Holder110180178","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Libertarian110257524","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_4516","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type28":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type33":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Helmer","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Intellectual109621545","comment4":"Roger Helmer (born 25 January 1944) is a British Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East Midlands region, and is Head of Delegation for the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999 and stood down in 2009.He is married to Carolyn and has two grown up children, Jonathan and Katie. In the 1970s he was a partner in a firm of Manchester lawyers Maurice Rubin & Co.After standing unsuccessfully for Manchester Wythenshawe in 1979, being beaten by Labour's Alf Morris, Sumberg was the Member of Parliament for Bury South, from 1983 to 1997. He had also been a Manchester City Councillor.  As an MP he acted as the Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Attorney General,  Sir Patrick Mayhew.He seconded the Loyal Humble Address of Ian Gow MP in November 1989; a privilege that was traditionally afforded only once to an MP.  During the occasion he was criticized by Eric Heffer MP for making a personal reference.  \"An earnest man ... of considerable courage\", remarked Neil Kinnock MP, when making the opposition reply to the address.  \"graciously he might become something of a rolling stone... until then...\", joked the Labour leader.After losing his seat in 1997, the Labour Government published correspondence about the \"Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry\", during which period Sumberg was PPS to the Home Office.  It was revealed a constituent had written the MP aghast at no inquiry going forward.As an MEP, he said that he was \"not a signed up member\" of the \"European Project\" and did not support a more centralised European Union, \"unlike most of my MEP colleagues\".He has been criticised by members of other political parties and the national media for his low attendance and political inactivity.  Although he has made speeches on other occasions. From 2004 to 2008 he made only two speeches and gave twelve \u201cexplanations of votes\u201d - a total of 536 words. He has also tabled only five questions and has not written any of the reports or tabled any resolutions to the one committee he sat on. His local rival, Chris Davies MEP, said he would undoubtedly make the shortlist for Britain's laziest MEP.  Defending himself, he said speeches in the European Parliament did not achieve a great deal as they are to empty chambers with no-one listening.When he stepped down from the European Parliament, his reasons were made public.He paid his wife \u00a354,000 per year from the staff allowance and claimed \u00a340,000 per year in office expenses; he used the North West England Conservative Campaigns Centre as a forwarding address to his house in his north London, where he claimed the expenses.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActor","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Associate109816771","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncilMember109944763","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CouncillorsInManchester","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","name":"David Sumberg","type2":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person"},{"type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_4540","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromTipton","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_Bradbourn","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PhysicalEntity100001930","comment4":"Philip Charles Bradbourn OBE MEP (9 August 1951 \u2013 19 December 2014) was a British politician, and Member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands, for the Conservative Party.

In May 1999, Paksas was appointed Prime Minister, but resigned five months later after a disagreement over privatisation. Paksas joined the Liberal Union of Lithuania (LLS) in 2000. The LLS won the 2000 election, and Paksas became PM again, but he left within seven months after another dispute over economic reforms.In 2002, Paksas founded the Liberal Democratic Party, and ran for the presidency, winning the run-off against incumbent Valdas Adamkus in January 2003. It emerged that he had granted citizenship to a major campaign donor, leading to his impeachment and removal from office in April 2004. He was the first European head of state to have been impeached. Barred from the Seimas, Paksas was elected to the European Parliament in 2009, while leading his party, now called Order and Justice (TT). His lifetime ban from the Seimas was ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011.","type46":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PrimeMinistersOfLithuania","type36":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo"},{"type8":"http://schema.org/Person","type23":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/MinistersOfForeignAffairsOfLithuania","type15":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Minister110320863","type17":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Organism100004475","purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_96696","type5":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q215627","type18":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Person100007846","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algirdas_Saudargas","type16":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Object100002684","comment4":"Algirdas Saudargas (born April 17, 1948 in Kaunas, Lithuania, is a Lithuanian politician and the signatory of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania.

He joined the National Front at the age of fourteen and, following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, became a political worker for the party. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for several right-wing magazines. He was the National Front's candidate for the seat of Croydon North West in 1981 and 1983, but left the party in 1989.  In 1995 he joined the BNP and in 1999 became its leader. He stood as the party's candidate in several elections and became a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European elections.In 1998 Griffin was convicted of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006 he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought to distance himself from some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.","type36":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingPeople"},{"purl":"http://purl.org/linkedpolitics/EUmember_96752","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Hausling","name":"Martin H\u00c4Usling"},{"comment3":"Sabine Verheyen (born 24 October 1964 in Aachen) is a German politician and Member of the European Parliament.

From October 2005 to November 2007 he was the Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General. He was elected to the Sejm on September 25, 2005 in the 13th Krak\u00f3w district, running on the Law and Justice list. He received over 120,000 votes in the parliamentary election, the highest percentage constituency result on a nationwide scale.Ziobro graduated from the Faculty of Law and Administration of Jagiellonian University. He did not complete his PhD. He was a member of the Sejm from 2001-2005.Due to his proclaimed \"battle against corruption\", he became one of the more popular, but also polarizing, politicians in Poland. His uncompromising approach and publicized prosecutions earned him the title Man of the year 2006, awarded by Wprost magazine. However, some of his policies were repeatedly characterized as partisan and overzealous by local and international press, including The Economist.In 2007, former Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Janusz Kaczmarek, allegedly linked to the Andrzej Lepper bribery case, was forced to resign.

A business that generates more than \u20ac 400 billion per year for the counterfeiting networks and puts at risk the life of patients. The proposed directive, and negotiated for almost two years, with the parliamentary groups and the governments, would be approved in 2011. Marisa Matias was the second time since Portugal\u2019s entrance at the EU a Portuguese MEP, which leaded the process of a framework-directive, a law that will be transposed to the judicial system of the each of the 28 member States until 2016. At the same time, she was also rapporteur of the European strategy in the fight against Alzheimer and other dementias, that would equally be approved in 2011.

Later, the report would be approved, in plenary, still in 2013, but Marisa Matias requested her name to be withdraw as a result of approved changes in the final vote. Those changed took out of the report all the critical references to the ECB as member of the Troika, equally eliminating the proposal to oblige the ECB to restore to the countries under the Troika\u2019s intervention the profits resulting from the complex processes of buying and selling of public debt titles. Marisa Matias was, still, the Parliament\u2019s rapporteur for four opinion on European strategy for adapting to climate change, resettling of GDP calculation, proposal for a new pluri-annual financing framework and regulation defining indexes on the goods traded in stock market.As shadow rapporteur, meaning, MEP responsible within its parliamentary group, to follow and negotiate proposals leaded by other colleagues from other parliamentary groups, Marisa Matias followed, during the mandate, the making of 25 parliamentary proposals, having presented proposals for change and being present in negotiation meetings.

She has a degree in Law.In 2008, she was in the center of a controversy regarding the placement of the Spanish flag in the seat of the Basque Parliament: the Spanish Law on Flags requires that all public institutions place the Spanish flag on a prominent place wherever the regional or local flags fly. After years of not submitting to such law and flying only the Ikurri\u00f1a (Basque flag), the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that the Basque Parliament would have to fly the Spanish flag too. In the Bureau meeting that studied the ruling, Izaskun Bilbao sided with the non-nationalist minority in the Parliament ruling body to actually place the flag against the official policy of her party. She defended this decision as simply obeying the final ruling of the Supreme Court, and thus having nothing to do with politics.","type24":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/PeopleFromBermeo","type7":"http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Agent","type9":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Adult109605289","type21":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/YagoLegalActorGeo","type4":"http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#NaturalPerson","type6":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5","type11":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/CausalAgent100007347","type14":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/LivingThing100004258","type1":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person","type10":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/BasqueNationalistPartyPoliticians","type20":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Whole100003553","type12":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Lawyer110249950","type19":"http://dbpedia.org/class/yago/Professional110480253","comment6":"Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (Bermeo, March 27, 1961) is a politician from the Basque Country, a region in Spain.
