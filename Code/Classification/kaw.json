Due to his dominant position in Italian politics, critics often refer to him as Re Giorgio (\"King George\"). He is the longest serving President in the history of the modern Italian Republic, existent from 1946.Although the presidency is a nonpartisan office as guarantor of Italy's Constitution, Napolitano was a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party (and of its post-Communist successors, from the Democratic Party of the Left onwards). He was a leading member of a modernizing faction on the right of the party. First elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life, and was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 1994. He was Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 under Romano Prodi.Napolitano was appointed a Senator for life in 2005 by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In May 2006, he was elected by parliament as President of Italy. During his first term of office, he oversaw governments both of the centre-left, led by Prodi, and the centre-right, led by Silvio Berlusconi. In November 2011, Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister amid financial and economic problems.  Napolitano, in keeping with his constitutional role, then asked former EU commissioner Mario Monti to form  a cabinet of unelected professionals, which became widely referred to as a \"government of the president\".When his seven-year presidential term expired in April 2013, Napolitano (then aged 87) reluctantly agreed to stand again, to safeguard the continuity of the country's institutions during the parliamentary deadlock that followed the 2013 general election. On being reelected as President with broad cross-party support in parliament, he overcame the impasse by inviting Enrico Letta to propose a government in the form of a grand coalition. When Letta handed in his resignation on 14 February 2014, Napolitano mandated Matteo Renzi (Letta's factional challenger) to form a new government. After a record eight and a half years as president, Napolitano resigned at age 89 in January 2015.",

His progression in the late 1980s is known as the \"Lepénisation des esprits\" or lepénisation of spirits due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. Lepenism in France refers to his eurosceptic, nationalist and conservative ideas. His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure that polarizes opinion, considered as the \"Devil of the Republic\" among his opponents or as the last samurai in politics among his supporters. His progress to the second round in the 21 April 2002 presidential election left its mark on French public life, and the \"21st of April\" is now a frequently used expression in France. Since the \"de-demonization of the Front national\" by Marine Le Pen, his daughter and successor, he is more absent in public life but still active at a lower level. A June 2014 poll showed that 91% of the French have a bad opinion of him.Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. He advocates immigration restrictions, the death penalty, raising incentives for homemakers, and euroscepticism. He strongly opposes same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and abortion.",

Following the election, he became a member of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP).He was minister of Industry in Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's cabinet from 1986 to 1988, a minister of Business in Prime Minister Édouard Balladur's cabinet from 1993 to 1995, and a minister of Economy and Finances in Prime Minister Alain Juppé's cabinet. He resigned after only four months, citing economic policy differences with Alain Juppé.He was a member of the National Assembly from 1978 to 2007 as representative for Ille-et-Vilaine's fourth circumscription. The district includes the town of Redon, where he was mayor from 1995 until 2001.Madelin unsuccessfully ran in 1996 for president of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), and was defeated by François Léotard. He was elected as leader of the Parti Républicain, a part of the UDF coalition, which he renamed Démocratie Libérale. In 1998, Démocratie Libérale split from the UDF. Madelin's obtained slightly less than 4% of the vote in the 2002 presidential election and merged his party into the UMP. After 2002, although his former supporter Jean-Pierre Raffarin became Prime minister, and as a result of the end of Démocratie Libérale, Madelin's influence in French national politics dwindled.Madelin is the French major politician the most in favor of the international policies of the United States, and supported the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because of this, he has, in the past, generally been considered with favor by the US press.In July 2005, Alain Madelin rumors reported in the Canard Enchaîné stated that he would run for the OCDE  and that he would be supported by both Jacques Chirac (who allegedly wanted to get rid of him) and George W. Bush (since Madelin is traditionally France's important politician closest to the United States). He did not run and Angel Gurria of Mexico was chosen.Alain Madelin did not seek reelection in the 2007 elections, ending his involvement in partisan politics.",

    "abstract": "Caroline Jackson (born 5 November 1946 in Penzance, Cornwall) is a politician in the United Kingdom. She was a Member of the European Parliament for the Conservative Party from 1984 to 2009.Before she became an MEP, Jackson was a Research Fellow at St.Hugh's College Oxford, where she obtained a doctorate in 19th century political history. She worked at the Conservative Research Department from 1973 to 1974 and fought the constituency of Birmingham Erdington in the February 1974 General Election. She then became a member of the research team supporting the first British Conservative MEPs from 1974 -1984.She was elected to represent the Wiltshire constituency from 1984 to 1994, then the new Wiltshire North and Bath from 1994 to 1999 and from 1999 to 2009 served as an MEP for the South West England constituency.In the European Parliament, she was a leading member of the Environment Committee and between 1999 and 2004 was Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Consumer Protection and Public Health. During her chairmanship she tried to focus attention as much on Member States' performance in transposing and applying new EU laws as on the adoption of more such laws. This was during a period of very intense legislation in the area of water and air pollution, waste disposal and controls on chemicals. Jackson controlled the committee firmly but with humour – qualities very necessary when German opponents of new laws on alternative medicines attempted to control proceedings in 1995. It was noted that on 11 September 2001 Jackson's committee was the only one that did not adjourn when the news of the attacks on New York came through: Jackson argued that abrupt abandonment of the Committee's work would have been another small victory for the terrorists. Jackson has been described by Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies thus: \"She's been here forever: a bit 'jolly hockey sticks' but firm, fair and funny.\" Jackson specialised, as parliamentary rapporteur, on waste legislation. She took the Landfill Directive through the Parliament in 1997-8. In 2008 she was rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. Initially criticised as being too close to the waste industry lobby, Jackson managed to unite most of her opponents in support of an ambitious final text which the Council of Ministers only agreed with reluctance. This placed an obligation on Member States to achieve recycling rates of 50% by 2020, created for the Commission the possibility of putting in place waste reduction targets and cleared up the question of the status of incineration of waste as a form of \"recovery\" rather than \"disposal\".Jackson believed that David Cameron was wrong to direct the Conservative MEPs to leave the European People's Party in 2009 because this meant a huge loss of political influence. She pointed out that the Conservatives had in fact enjoyed a high level of political independence within the EPP. She argued that the Conservatives' new position from 2009 in the \"Conservatives and European Reformists group\" with the Czech ODS party, the Polish Law and Justice party and a motley crew of European rightists, would mean that they would lose influence and visibility in the European Parliament at precisely the moment when the Parliament's powers were increasing. She made her views known in press articles in 2009 and Cameron feared that she might follow her  husband, Robert V. Jackson, MP for Wantage (1983-2005) in abandoning the Conservative party for the Labour Party. But she remained a Conservative and the party paid tribute to her work when she left the Parliament, William Hague pointing out that Jackson was \"always ahead of the curve\".She retired at the 2009 European Parliament Elections. She now works as an environmental consultant. She is a member of Foresight Advisory Council of GDF Suez Environment and a Board member of the Institute for European Environment Policy.",

Mann was a member of the Hanseatic Mann family and portrayed his family and class in the novel Buddenbrooks. His older brother was the radical writer Heinrich Mann and three of his six children, Erika Mann, Klaus Mann and Golo Mann, also became important German writers. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Mann fled to Switzerland. When World War II broke out in 1939, he immigrated to the United States, returning to Switzerland in 1952.

He gave up his membership of the Volksunie in 1977 after it acceded to a much-debated package of federal reforms. Vanhecke subsequently joined the Vlaams Nationale Partij, the predecessor of the Vlaams Blok.Quickly climbing the party ranks, he became responsible for the party's press and media communication in 1986 and worked from 1989 as a personal assistant to Karel Dillen in the European Parliament, until he was elected to a Parliamentary seat himself in 1994. After a short term in the Belgian Senate, Vanhecke returned to European politics after the elections in 2004.Vanhecke sits on its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and is a substitute for the Committee on Development and a member of theDelegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee.  His voting record in the European Parliament shows his clear pro-life stance.When Karel Dillen resigned from his post as chairman of the Vlaams Blok in 1996, Vanhecke was designated as his successor. He was elected in 2001.In November 2004 the Vlaams Blok was dissolved and a new political party was created under the name Vlaams Belang. Vanhecke was appointed chairman of this new party.",

Later, he was a Member of the European Parliament from 1995 to 2004. Early in his career, Gahrton was elected chairman of the youth and student wing of the Swedish Liberal Party, in 1969. In 1971 he was challenged for the post by Lars Leijonborg due to ideological tensions; Leijonborg succeeded him after a narrow win. Gahrton entered in 1976 as a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party. He was re-elected in 1979 but left the parliament and the party the same year, expressing disenchantment with the parliament bureaucracy. Turning to the nascent Green Party, in the 1980s he was one of its founders in 1981 and one of its more high-profile men for many years, one of relatively few in the new party who had several years of prior experience of professional politics before joining; he served as one of two spokespersons for the party from 1984 to 1985. He also served as a Member of Parliament for the Green Party from 1988 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 2004 he was a Member of the European Parliament. He is an outspoken eurosceptic and was one of the leading proponents of the \"no\"-side in the 1994 Swedish European Union membership referendum (which was won by the \"yes\"-side).Gahrton currently serves as Presidentof the Swedish Association for Solidarity with Palestine.In December 2008, Gahrton sharply criticized the a European Union proposal ”Guidelines for strengthening the political dialogue structures with Israel” arguing that the guidelines in fact were meant to establish \"a Security Pact with Israel.\" He also argued that due to \"the well-known Israeli skill in lobbying and in influencing opinions worldwide, it is no exaggeration to argue that from now on and for all practical purposes the Middle East Policy of the EU will be elaborated, even co-written, by Israel.\" In March 2009, Gahrton participated in a large protest against the Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel in Malmo. Under orders from local politicians, the match was played behind closed doors. Gahrton claimed that this decision had already given demonstrators some success, stating that \"We have been helped by brave politicians in Malmö. We thank them for that.\"Gahrton is the author of \"Life and Death in the European Parliament\", part political thriller, part tell-all memoir. The book was criticized by fellow parliament members as being a thinly disguised rip-off of Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\", which dominated Sweden's best seller lists at the time, and Gahrton accused of wanting to cash in on Brown's success. Consequently, Gahrton was forced to distribute the book free of charge.Gahrton has described himself as Jewish according to the traditional Jewish definition, as his matrilineal family, viz. his maternal grandmother's mother, was Jewish.",

However, the party had ambitiously fielded four candidates and Hyland was the only one not returned to the 21st Dáil.

Fianna Fáil again put forward four candidates, but this time Hyland was the first of three to be elected, taking his seat in the 22nd Dáil. He was re-elected at the five subsequent general elections, of February 1982, November 1982, 1987, 1989 and 1992.In his six terms in Dáil Éireann, Hyland achieved ministerial office only briefly. In the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, he was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food from February 1992 to January 1993, serving under Joe Walsh.In the 1994 European Parliament election, he was elected as a MEP for the Leinster constituency, and he did not contest the 1997 general election.

In 1998 he became president of the Paneuropa-Union Deutschland, the German branch of the International Paneuropean Union.Posselt is the leading German advocate of the rights of those Germans whose ancestors lived in the Sudetenland area of Bohemia as well as Moravia and who were expelled by the Potsdam conference and the governments in Central and Eastern Europe after the Second World War. His main goal - and the principal aim of the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft that he has led since 2000 - is to revoke the so-called Beneš decrees, as well as other acts of the post-war expulsions that were meant to punish the German population in the Sudetenland as a whole for its prevailing support of Nazism.Posselt is respected in the Sudeten German community and in his home state of Bavaria. The conservative Bavarian government has often supported the Sudeten German community, and was among those demanding that the Czech Republic should repeal the Beneš decrees before being allowed into European Union.",

From 2005–2007 she chaired the Swedish Assembly of Finland.After the 2007 elections she was chosen to be the new Minister of Migration and European Affairs in Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet.During 2007 and 2011 Thors became a target of the increasing anti-immigration and anti-EU sentiment. She received death threats that were consequently investigated by the police, and faced a lot of criticism, in parliament and especially on chat and blogging sites. This regardless of the fact that during her term, the Finnish immigration policy continued to tighten outside the EU directives. The critique Minister Thors faced subsequently led to a decision not to continue this ministerial position in Prime Minister Katainen's government, and immigration policy was returned under the Interior Minister's wings and EU policy was given to the new position of the Minister of European Affairs and Foreign Trade.On 17 July 2013, she was appointed OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.",

    "abstract": "Graham Harry Booth (29 March 1940 – 14 December 2011) was an English politician, and was a Member of the European Parliament for South West England between 2002 and 2008.  He was a member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Booth was born in Paignton, Devon and educated at Torquay Boys' Grammar School. Before he entered politics, he was a businessman in the building and tourism trades. In the 1999 European Parliament elections, Booth was the number two candidate on the UKIP list for South West England.  Consequently he became an MEP in 2002 as the replacement for Michael Holmes, former party leader, when Holmes resigned from the European Parliament. Booth was re-elected in 2004 with a greatly increased vote. In the 2005 General Election he contested the Torbay constituency in Devon, and gained 7.9% of the vote.UKIP MEPs frequently claim that the European Parliament is a powerless talking shop, with real lawmaking power resting with the European Commission. However, Graham Booth is credited with having helped save the Isles of Scilly helicopter shuttle service in his constituency by means of an astute parliamentary speech in 2003. The service, which is crucial to life on the islands, had been threatened with closure by a heavy-handed interpretation of a new EU directive aimed at larger airlines. Following Booth's speech, an alliance between UKIP and the UK Labour Party MEPs persuaded the EU Transport Commissioner to amend the directive, allowing the service (and similar 'social carriers' across Europe) to continue in business.Booth retired from his role as a UKIP MEP on 1 October 2008 and was replaced by the next candidate on the list, Trevor Colman. He continued to be a keen activist in and around the bay until his death in December 2011.",

Her professional political career started in 1971 when on behalf of Hugo Schiltz she was stood candidate and was elected for the Volksunie into the Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives, where she seated until 1977, becoming an elected senator in the next year, 1978, until 1981. Upon being elected as vice-president of the party she left parlementary work, as the Volksunie went through rough seas internally in those days, when separists and regionalists, leftists and conservatives could't find a way to solve the problems concerning the whereabouts of the party which saw its political aims come true when the Belgian state deeply reformed itself from a unitarian state into a federation.In 1985 she returned to her seat in the Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives, leaving there in 1991, again to continue in the Belgian Senate. But in 1995 she changed places and became a member of the newly formed Flemish Parliament until 1998, when elected into the European Parliament for the European Free Alliance.In 2001 the Volksunie split, after which Maes, who was very much against the split, joined Spirit. Alliancepartner Sp.a put their own five favourable candidates on the highest places on the mutual election list for the European elections in 2004, Maes being sixth. Unfortunately only five members were elected, so Maes is without a parlementary seat nowadays.However, she was pointed as the president of the European Free Alliance, and as president of the Flemish Peace Institute, an organisation closely related to the Flemish Parliament.Maes always stood firm for regional culturalism, regional languages, the environment and women's liberation, which caused her fame as being \"Red Nelly\".",

In the spring 1999, the Finnish MEP Sirkka-Liisa Anttila opted to resign three months before her term was up to accept a position in the Parliament of Finland. Pohjamo, having been second runner-up in the previous election (Olli Rehn, the first Centre Party runner-up, declined), became a member for the brief period until the next election, the following summer.In the 1999 European Parliament elections, Pohjamo was re-elected with a 25,000 votes, most of them coming from his home region in Oulu. During his five-year term he served as a member of the Committee on Regional Development.In the 2004 election, Pohjamo increased his tally of votes to 27,490, but his lack of nation-wide support (only 3,000 of those votes came from outside the Oulu electoral district) caused him to fall short of the mark, becoming his party's first runner-up. When fellow Centre Party representative Paavo Väyrynen resigned his membership in the European Parliament to move into the position of Finland's Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, Pohjamo was once again raised from the position of runner-up into a parliament member.Samuli Pohjamo has been an editor-in-chief in Suomenmaa.",

He has been the leader of the Direction – Social Democracy (SMER-SD) party since 1999. First elected to Parliament in 1992 (whilst within Czechoslovakia), he was later appointed to the Council of Europe. Following his party's victory in the 2006 parliamentary election, he formed the first Fico Cabinet.While later in opposition, Fico again sat as a member of parliament, effectively as leader of the opposition. Following a motion of confidence against the Iveta Radičová cabinet, Fico was re-appointed as Prime Minister after leading SMER-SD to a landslide election victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, winning 83 seats and forming a government with an absolute majority in Parliament, the first such since 1989.In 2013, Fico officially declared his candidacy for the 2014 presidential election, but he lost to Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting on 29 March 2014.",

He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency from 1977 to 2007, and an ALDE Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East constituency from 2004 to 2014,Liam Aylward was born in Mullinavat, County Kilkenny in 1952. He was educated at St Kierans College, Kilkenny. He worked as a laboratory technician before getting involved in politics. He was elected to Kilkenny County Council in 1974, serving on that authority until 1992.  Aylward was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency at the 1977 general election in what proved to be a landslide for Fianna Fáil. Since then he has served as Minister of State at the Department of Energy (1988–1989), at the Department of Education (1992–1994) and at the Department of Agriculture and Food (2002–2004). In 1998 Aylward was the subject of a complaint to Oireachtas authorities for groping a female usher in the dail bar for which he apologised. In 2004 he was elected to the European Parliament in the East constituency for Fianna Fáil, which was then part of the Union for a Europe of Nations. Since the 2009 European Parliament election, Fianna Fáil is affiliated with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). Aylward is a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the delegation for relations with Mercosur and the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly. Aylward is also a substitute member of the Committee on Culture and Education and the delegation to the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Because dual mandate legislation forbids Members of the European Parliament from seeking re-election as members of their national legislatures, Liam Aylward retired from national politics at the 2007 general election. He was succeeded as a Fianna Fáil TD by his brother, Bobby Aylward. He is the son of the Bob Aylward who served as a Fianna Fáil senator.Aylward has opted not to receive a ministerial pension but still receives annual pension payments of around €50,000 from his time as a TD.He retired from politics at the 2014 European Parliament election.",

Sinnott founded the Hope Project in 1996. She married Declan Sinnott when they were both aged twenty one, and had 9 children (3 daughters and 6 sons) together, they are now separated. In 2000, she took a court case to force the Irish government to provide a primary school education for her son Jamie who has multiple disabilities. In 2001, High Court ruled that every person in Ireland had a constitutional right to free appropriate primary education based on need. The judgement confirmed that this was a fundamental right which was not limited by the availability of resources.  The government did not challenge  the High Court decision for children 18 years and younger  but successfully appealed its application to persons over 18 years of age to the Supreme Court.",

She was also a substitute for the Committee on Culture and Education and a member of the Delegation to the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.In August 2005 Robsahm was convicted of accounting irregularities following the bankruptcy in a company owned jointly by Robsahm (then Carlhamre) and her former husband. She was given a suspended sentence. As a result of the conviction, the leadership of the Liberal People's Party called on her to resign from her seat in the European Parliament. Instead, she left the party and joined Feminist Initiative. This move received some Swedish media attention for the fact that one of the two co-leaders of the Feminist Initiative, Gudrun Schyman, had been convicted on another finance-related crime, tax evasion.",

    "abstract": "Esther Silvana Koch-Mehrin (born 17 November 1970 in Wuppertal) is a German politician and former Member of the European Parliament with the Free Democratic Party of Germany. Until May 2011, she was Vice Chairwoman of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. She is a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets. She also is a substitute member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and a member of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union (including Libya).During the campaign for the 2009 European Parliament election, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) criticised Koch-Mehrin for attending only 39% of the parliamentary debates, not counting maternity leave. She answered back and gave a statutory declaration that she had participated in 75% of the debates. The European Parliament then published a corrected number of 62%, with maternity leave taken into consideration. Since giving a wrong statutory declaration is a criminal act, the European Parliament's administration reviewed additional attendance lists Koch-Mehrin provided. Mehrin's party urged a preliminary injunction against the FAZ, but withdrew it soon after.In 2009, she was elected Vice President of the European Parliament.",

During his political career, he was nicknamed \"The Plumber\" and \"The Minesweeper\" for his ability to negotiate political deadlocks. A member of the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD&V) party and its antecedents, Dehaene gained his first ministerial appointment in 1981. Dehaene's first government (1992–1995) included both Christian and Social Democrats and presided over the creation of a new constitution, effectively transforming Belgium into a federal state. His second government (1995–1999) coincided with a number of crises in Belgium including the Dutroux scandal. The Dioxin Affair, occurring shortly before the 1999 election, led to a swing against the major parties and Dehaene's government fell. Following his final term as Prime Minister he was active in both Belgian and European politics. He was also on UEFA's financial fair play regulatory body and managed Dexia Bank during the financial crisis. Dehaene holds the distinction of being the last prime minister of King Baudouin's reign.",

    "abstract": "Jaime Mayor Oreja, (born 12 July 1951, in San Sebastián) is a Spanish politician who served as Interior Minister in the People's Party government of José María Aznar before resigning in February 2001 to stand for Basque President on 13 May 2001, a post he failed to win. He is known for his strongly anti-ETA views. Grandson of Marcelino Oreja Elósegui, the ultraconservative Carlist politician.He graduated in agronomic engineering. In 1977 he joined the Unión de Centro Democrático (UCD) and from 1979 to 1982 represented Guipúzcoa in the Spanish Parliament. On 9 March 1980 he was elected  Member of the Basque Parliament. On 30 July 1982 he was appointed as the Government's Delegate in the Basque Country by the then President Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo. On 16 October a grenade was unsuccessfully thrown against his office window, and he was not hurt. On 29 December the new Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government of Felipe González removed him from office. In February 1983 the UCD disbanded and he joined Óscar Alzaga's Democratic Popular Party. On 26 February 1984 he stood for the position of Basque President for the Democratic Coalition, but failed to win. The coalition collapsed after the general elections of June 1986. He then tried to create another party within the Basque Country but was unable to generate enough interest until in March 1987 he founded a new party, Union of the Basque People (UPV). In 1989 he joined the newly formed People's Party and was elected  Deputy in the Congress of Deputies for Vizcaya, although he also represented Alava on separate occasions. At the tenth Party Congress on 31 March 1990 he was elected to the National Executive of the People's Party as the president of the Basque section. After the Peoples's party victory in the 1996 General Elections he was sworn in as Minister of the Interior on 6 May 1996 along with the other members of the new PP government, a post in which he remained until April 2001. In May 2001 he unsuccessfully ran for the Basque presidency again, coming second against incumbent Juan Jose Ibarretxe. Upon being defeated, he was briefly the People's Party parliamentary leader in the Basque Parliament. During his tenure in the Basque Parliament, he famously failed to be present in key debates such as the 2002 budget debate; without his vote, the opposition failed to secure enough votes to overturn the budget, which enabled Ibarretxe's minority government to successfully pass it by simple majority. He resigned his seat in 2004 to lead the People's Party list for the 2004 European Parliament Election and was elected. During his tenure in the European Parliament, he kept a low profile, being one of the least active MEPs during the 2004-2014 decade. He positioned himself as one of the visible leaders of the People's Party right wing faction, and one of the party's hard-liners against Basque terrorism. In January 2014 he announced he would not be running again for the European Parliament due to public disagreements with prime minister Mariano Rajoy's government's policies towards ETA, the basque terrorist group. Since then, he has joined FAES, the People's Party think-tank.",

Before entering politics, he was a Chartered Surveyor.As a member of the Conservative Party, he was elected MP for Stroud in 1987.  Between 1990 and 1992, he served asParliamentary Private Secretary to the armed forces minister, Archie Hamilton. He resigned from this position in order to oppose the Maastricht Treaty. He successfully defended his seat in the 1992 general election. In 1995 he became a government whip. In 1997, however, he lost his seat to the Labour candidate, David Drew.Shortly afterwards, Knapman left the Conservative party to join UKIP. He stood as their candidate in the 2001 general election for North Devon, coming fourth yet narrowly retaining his deposit.From 2000, he was UKIP's political advisor, and in 2002 he was elected unopposed as party leader.  In 2004 he was elected a Member of the European Parliament for the South West England constituency. As leader of the only British party in the European Parliament to vote against the expansion of the EU in 2004 (and publicly opposing immigration), there was some amusement in May 2006 when it was revealed that he had employed a team of Polish builders to renovate his Grade II listed home in Devon, claiming there were no suitable local workers – a claim denied by local builders.He contested Totnes at the 2005 general election, coming 4th with 7.7% of the vote.He announced in 2006 that he had no intention of seeking re-election as party leader; the leadership contest was won in September of that year by Nigel Farage MEP. Knapman was the only leader of UKIP to have succeeded in completing a full four-year term until Farage successfully did so in 2014 after returning to the role in 2010.",

He was elected for the UK Independence Party in the European elections of 2004 and 2009, representing UKIP until September 2013, when UKIP withdrew the party whip from him. He then sat as an Independent until the end of his term of office in May 2014. Bloom subsequently resigned his UKIP party membership on 13 October 2014.During his tenure, he received attention for making remarks considered objectionable by his party leader, for his opinions concerning climate change and for making other controversial comments. On 20 September 2013, UKIP withdrew the party whip from Bloom after he struck journalist Michael Crick in the street, threatened a second reporter, and at the party's conference referred to his female audience as sluts. Bloom resigned his party whip from UKIP on 24 September 2013 and thereafter sat as an Independent MEP until the end of his term in office on 2 July 2014.",

She is a member of the Democratic Party (DP).Polfer succeeded her father, Camille Polfer, as mayor of Luxembourg City, when he was forced to resign from the position due to poor health after only two years.  She was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 1984 election, representing Centre.  She was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the government of Jean-Claude Juncker from August 1999 until July 2004.In the 2004 legislative election, Polfer was elected, once again, top of the DP list, coming second overall to Luc Frieden.  However, the DP polled poorly overall, losing five seats nationwide, and, with them, their position as the second-largest party and kingmakers.  As such, the CSV entered instead into a coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP), ejecting Polfer from the government.  The European Parliament election held on the same day also saw the DP lose votes, as well as fall to fourth, behind the Greens for the first time.  Nonetheless, Polfer still came top of the DP list (and third overall), and took her place in the European Parliament, where the DP sit in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.She is now Mayor of Luxembourg City, after being mayor there from 1982 to 1999.  Polfer is a Vice Chair of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.",

He was member of PACE from 1993 till 1997 and from 2003 till 2007.In 2011 the European Parliament opened a formal investigation into alleged corruption by Severin and two other MEPs, based on an investigation conducted by journalists of the Sunday Times weekly (part of The Times of London). The Romanian politician insisted he had done nothing that was \"illegal or against any normal behavior\". Mr. Severin is accused of accepting bribe in exchange for initiating some law amendment, and is recorded on video by the journalists when requesting and accepting the bribe. Subsequently, he was called by the Leader of the SD Group in the European Parliament to resign. As he refused, he was suspended from his position as Deputy-Leader of the SD Group and had to leave this Parliamentary Group.",

For many years he was international secretary in the Swedish Social Democratic Party and a close assistant to the Swedish prime minister Olof Palme. He assisted Palme in the Socialist International Movement and took part in the struggle against the fascist rule in Greece, Portugal and Spain. In April 2005 he was appointed Special Representative for Côte d'Ivoire by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (UNOCI, succeeded by Choi Young-jin from South Korea in October 2007). He was Secretary General of Sweden's foreign ministry 1982–91, later member of the cabinet 1994–99 and Deputy Foreign Minister responsible for issues of foreign aid and migration, Social Democratic member of the European Parliament, and Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations. Schori was appointed election supervisor in Zimbabwe 2002 by the European Union. He was also suggested as the United Nations' administrator for Kosovo, but never became one after protests from the United States. They objected to Schori's prior support for Fidel Castro and other socialist regimes. Schori responded by accusing the Bush administration of \"McCarthyism\" [1].Since March 2007 Schori has been General Director of FRIDE, a think-tank based in Madrid.Schori is sympathetically portrayed as Peter Sorman in the fellow 1968-radical Jan Guillou's Hamilton novels, with a clearly anti-imperialist attitude, at least as critical against the United States as against China or the Soviet Union. In a TV interview on February 22, 2004 the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, called Schori and former Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson \"professional anti-Israelis\".",

He sat in the local medical board, the social welfare board, the municipal government and the City Council. Between 1991-1994 he was a member of the Swedish Riksdag. Upon finishing his mandate, Schmidt returned to local and regional politics where he was significant in the transformation of Scania from a county to a region, which is today known as Region Skåne.In 1999, Schmidt's friend and political colleague Marit Paulsen encouraged him to stand for election to the European Parliament.

    "abstract": "Hans Modrow (German pronunciation: [ˈhans ˈmoːdʁo]; born 27 January 1928) is a German politician, best known as the last communist premier of East Germany. He currently is the honorary Chairman of the Left Party.Modrow was born in Jasenitz, Province of Pomerania, Germany, now Jasienica  part of the town of Police, Poland. He briefly served in the Volkssturm, founded in 1944 by Adolf Hitler and was subsequently held as a prisoner of war. Upon release in 1949, he joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED).  Modrow had a long political career in East Germany, including periods as a member of the Volkskammer. From 1973 onward, he was the SED leader in Dresden, East Germany's third-largest city.  Modrow was widely reckoned as one of the few truly competent leaders in the East German hierarchy.  He was prevented from rising any further than a local party boss, however, largely because he was one of the few SED leaders who dared to publicly criticise longtime SED chief Erich Honecker.  Nonetheless, he developed some important contacts with the Soviet Union, including eventual Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  When Honecker was toppled in October 1989, Gorbachev hoped that Modrow would become the new leader of the SED.  However, Egon Krenz was selected instead.He became premier following the resignation of Willi Stoph on 18 November 1989.  After Krenz's resignation as leader of the SED on 3 December, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany.  The SED, which later changed its name to the Party of Democratic Socialism, had abandoned power two days earlier.  Modrow remained premier until the elections on 18 March 1990.After the German reunification, Modrow served as a member of the European Parliament (1999–2004) and of the Bundestag.In 1993 the German Federal Court found Modrow guilty of electoral fraud committed in the Dresden municipal elections in May 1989, specifically, understating the percentage of voters who refused to vote for the official slate.  (East Germany did not hold free elections until March 1990, and the outcome of any given election was never in doubt.)  The judge declined to impose a prison sentence or a fine. However, the court revoked its decision in 1995 and Modrow was sentenced to nine years on probation.  Modrow did not directly deny the charges, but argued that the trial was politically motivated and that the court lacked jurisdiction for crimes committed in East Germany.  \"We were all members of a political system,\" he said, speaking to the court in Dresden.  \"Some perhaps had the good fortune not to come into contact with manipulation, while others could not or were not allowed to turn away.\"",

She was a member of Fine Gael.Avril Belton was born in Dublin; she was educated at Holy Child Convent in Killiney and at University College, Dublin (UCD). Her father Richard Belton was a Senator and her grandfather Patrick Belton was a Teachta Dála (TD). In 1974, aged 25, she was elected to Wexford County Council and to Wexford Corporation; she was Mayor of Wexford town from 1975 to 1976. She was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the November 1982 general election as a Fine Gael TD for the Wexford constituency. She lost her seat at the 1989 general election but was re-elected at the 1992 general election, again losing her seat at the 1997 general election to party colleague Michael D'Arcy. She was a member of the Seanad from 1989–1992 and from 1997–2002. She was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) at the 1999 election and re-elected at the 2004 election. She served as a Minister of State in the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition governments of 1982–87 and 1994–97.Doyle made news during debate in the European Parliament in June 2008 after the rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon by Irish voters. A group of British Eurosceptic MEPs wore green hats and T-shirts, encouraging the EU to respect the Irish 'no' vote. However, many Irish MEPs saw this as self-serving and felt that there would be no Eurosceptic support for Irish opinion had the treaty been accepted; and Doyle was both lauded and criticised for the following comment, which is a reference to the forceful occupation of Ireland by Britain; \"How the history books could have been written differently, if respect for the Irish vote from some of our British colleagues was always there.\"She announced on 7 January 2009 that she would not be seeking re-election to the European Parliament at the 2009 election.On 21 June 2011 she announced her intention to seek the Fine Gael party nomination to run for President of Ireland. She withdrew from the nomination process in October 2011.",

At the 1999 European Parliament election, he was elected from third position on the Conservative Party list in the East of England, becoming the first British Muslim MEP.In 2004, Khanbhai repaid £7,000 of wrongly claimed travel expenses; although he lived in Sevenoaks, Kent, he had registered a boatyard in Wroxham as his home address. In light of this expenses scandal, he was deselected by his party, and did not stand in the 2004 election. He subsequently claimed that he had been treated differently from other Conservative MEPs in similar positions, ascribing this to racist elements within the party.",

    "abstract": "Jeffrey William Titford (born 24 October 1933, West Mersea, Essex) is a British politician who served as leader of the UK Independence Party from 2000 until 2002. He served again as interim leader in September to November 2010 following the resignation of Lord Pearson of Rannoch. He was also a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England from 1999 to 2009. He had been at various times a member of the Conservative Party (for whom he was a local councillor), the New Britain Party and the Referendum Party.  He was the most successful Referendum Party candidate in the 1997 general election, winning nearly 10 percent of the vote in Harwich.  However, later that year he joined the UKIP. In 1999, Titford became one of the first UKIP representatives to win a seat in the European Parliament. In 2000, UKIP's then leader, Michael Holmes, MEP, resigned amidst serious infighting. Jeffrey Titford narrowly won the ensuing leadership election, promising to reunite the party and restore its effectiveness as a campaigning organisation. This he largely succeeded in doing. The Guardian newspaper described him in 2001 as \"an emollient man, a sort of Willie Whitelaw figure, and an ideal leader for such a fractious party\". He led UKIP into the 2001 general election, in which it stood more than 420 candidates but failed to make any breakthroughs (although it did consolidate its position as the largest of the smaller parties). In October 2002, Titford stepped down as party leader to allow his successor time to lay out his strategy for the 2004 European Election. He also wanted to spend more time on political campaigns in the East of England, where he continued to be an active MEP. He was re-elected with a greatly increased share of the vote in the 2004 European elections. At this election, UKIP also returned a second MEP, Tom Wise.At the 2005 general election, Titford again contested Harwich. He came fourth of six candidates and polled 2,314 votes, a share of 4.6%, losing his deposit. Titford stepped down from the European Parliament at the 2009 European Parliament Election. He and Wise were succeeded as UKIP MEPs for the East of England by David Campbell-Bannerman and Stuart Agnew.Titford is regarded by many in UKIP as the nearest the party has to an elder statesman. In October 2005, UKIP's leader Roger Knapman announced that he was appointing Titford as party chairman for an interim period.Before entering politics he was a businessman. He was president of the National Association of Funeral Directors.",

Since 1999 he has been a Member of the European Parliament for South East England. He co-chairs the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (formerly \"Europe of Freedom and Democracy\") group.Farage was a founding member of UKIP, having left the Conservative Party in 1992 after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty. Having unsuccessfully campaigned in European and Westminster parliamentary elections for UKIP since 1994, he won a seat as MEP for South East England in the 1999 European Parliament Election – the first year the regional list system was used – and was re-elected in 2004, 2009, and 2014.In September 2006, Farage became the UKIP Leader and led the party through the 2009 European Parliament Election when it received the second-highest share of the popular vote, defeating Labour and the Liberal Democrats with over two million votes. He stepped down in November 2009 to concentrate on contesting Buckingham, the constituency of the Speaker, John Bercow, at the 2010 general election. Farage came third.In November 2010, Farage successfully stood in the 2010 UKIP leadership contest, following the resignation of Lord Pearson of Rannoch. Farage was ranked 41st in The Daily Telegraph's Top 100 most influential right-wingers poll in October 2009, citing his media awareness and his success with UKIP in the European Elections. Farage was ranked 58th in the 2010 list compiled by Iain Dale and Brian Brivati for The Daily Telegraph. In the 2012 edition of the same list Farage was ranked 17th, and in 2013 he was ranked second behind Prime Minister David Cameron. In 2014, he was ranked first, ahead of Cameron. He was also named \"Briton of the Year\" by The Times in 2014.In the 2014 European Election, Farage was re-elected again and led UKIP to its first victory in a nationwide UK election - the first for a party other than the Conservatives or Labour since the 1906 general election.Farage has been noted for his passionate and sometimes controversial speeches in the European Parliament and has strongly criticised the euro, the EU's single currency. In August 2014, Farage was selected to contest the South Thanet seat in Kent at the 2015 general election.",

He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999 and stood down in 2009.He is married to Carolyn and has two grown up children, Jonathan and Katie. In the 1970s he was a partner in a firm of Manchester lawyers Maurice Rubin & Co.After standing unsuccessfully for Manchester Wythenshawe in 1979, being beaten by Labour's Alf Morris, Sumberg was the Member of Parliament for Bury South, from 1983 to 1997. He had also been a Manchester City Councillor.  As an MP he acted as the Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Attorney General,  Sir Patrick Mayhew.He seconded the Loyal Humble Address of Ian Gow MP in November 1989; a privilege that was traditionally afforded only once to an MP.  During the occasion he was criticized by Eric Heffer MP for making a personal reference.  \"An earnest man ... of considerable courage\", remarked Neil Kinnock MP, when making the opposition reply to the address.  \"graciously he might become something of a rolling stone... until then...\", joked the Labour leader.After losing his seat in 1997, the Labour Government published correspondence about the \"Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry\", during which period Sumberg was PPS to the Home Office.  It was revealed a constituent had written the MP aghast at no inquiry going forward.As an MEP, he said that he was \"not a signed up member\" of the \"European Project\" and did not support a more centralised European Union, \"unlike most of my MEP colleagues\".He has been criticised by members of other political parties and the national media for his low attendance and political inactivity.  Although he has made speeches on other occasions. From 2004 to 2008 he made only two speeches and gave twelve “explanations of votes” - a total of 536 words. He has also tabled only five questions and has not written any of the reports or tabled any resolutions to the one committee he sat on. His local rival, Chris Davies MEP, said he would undoubtedly make the shortlist for Britain's laziest MEP.  Defending himself, he said speeches in the European Parliament did not achieve a great deal as they are to empty chambers with no-one listening.When he stepped down from the European Parliament, his reasons were made public.He paid his wife £54,000 per year from the staff allowance and claimed £40,000 per year in office expenses; he used the North West England Conservative Campaigns Centre as a forwarding address to his house in his north London, where he claimed the expenses.",

During 2005, Eurig Wyn was selected as Plaid Cymru's parliamentary candidate for the Ynys Môn constituency.  Prior to his selection, Eurig Wyn had spent about a year building up a profile in Ynys Môn with a view to eventually taking the seat back from the Labour Party (UK), following Plaid Cymru's loss in 2001.  The seat was the party's key target seat in the 2005 General Election; however, Plaid had their proportion of the vote reduced and the Labour Party held on to it, all main parties saw their vote fall due to independent candidate, Peter Rogers, who came 3rd and took a large share of the vote.",

He has farming and property interests in North East Fife and has extensive knowledge of the international financial services industry, having worked in the sector for several decades and having later contributed his expertise on relevant committees in the European Parliament. Purvis served as a second lieutenant in the Scots Guards (1956-1958) and graduated MA (Hons) from the University of St Andrews (1962). He worked for First National City Bank in London, New York and Milan (1962-1969) and was Treasurer of merchant bank Noble Grossart Ltd in Edinburgh (1969-1973). He was Managing Director and Chairman of Gilmerton Management Services Ltd St Andrews (1973-1986) and Chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party (1986-1997).

During his second term as an MEP, Purvis was Vice Chairman of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (2002-2009) and a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (1999-2009). He also served on EU delegations to the Gulf States and to Middle Eastern countries and served on the EU Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life Assurance Society crisis. During his 15 years as an MEP, Purvis produced a number of major reports which helped to shape EU policy – notably on biotechnology (supporting GM foods), telecommunications and financial regulation.In 2001, Purvis spoke out against the legality of actions by Customs and Excise officers who were confiscating alcohol and tobacco bought for personal use from travellers returning from the European Union saying such actions were illegal.In 2002, Purvis stated that he supported the building of a new airport in central Scotland as an alternative to upgrading the airports at Edinburgh or Glasgow.Since standing down in 2009, Purvis has continued to serve in Europe as Chairman of Financial Future which provides a means of dialogue between the financial services industries of  Europe and the EU’s legislators. He is also Chairman of Belgrave Capital Management in London, a Director of Kingdom FM Radio Ltd., Fife, and Advisor to the Board of Elmwood College in Cupar (2012).In 2008, it was alleged that Purvis may have breached rules regarding parliamentary expenses and the payment of staff through a company.

Well known as an EU-sceptic populist, he was elected a member of the Espoo city council in 2000 and the Parliament of Finland in 2003. In the 2009 European Parliament election he won a seat in the European Parliament with Finland's highest personal vote share (nearly 10% of all votes), becoming the first member of the Finns Party in the European Parliament.In the 2011 parliamentary election, his party won 19.1% of the votes, which was described as \"shocking\" and \"exceptional\" by the Finnish media. Soini himself won the most votes of all  candidates, leaving behind the Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb and the Minister of Finance Jyrki Katainen in their Uusimaa electoral district. Helsingin Sanomat concluded that \"Timo Soini rewrote the electoral history books\".Soini has become one of the internationally best-known critics of European Union bailouts and safety mechanisms. Soini's column \"Why I Don't Support Europe's Bailouts\" in the Wall Street Journal was the most read and emailed article of the magazine's daily European edition.",

He studied theology at the University of Helsinki.Repo's position on the Finnish Church's involvement in splitting the Estonian Orthodox Church led him into a conflict with metropolitan Johannes in the 1990s.Repo has been a popular speaker and commentator in radio and television talk shows. In addition to his church services, he has visited workers in their factories and financial and business leaders.Repo was asked by several parties to run as a candidate in European Parliament elections, and he finally chose the Social Democrats. His decision to stand in the election led to a conflict between Repo and the church leadership.In the end, the Finnish Orthodox Church banned him from serving in religious services and wearing his trademark priestly outfit.His candidacy and election to the EU Parliament in 2009 aroused some interest in the international press, e.g., in Le Monde and in The New York Times.During his term in the European Parliament, Mitro Repo served in the committee for culture and education and the committee for the internal market and consumer protection.",

    "abstract": "Rolandas Paksas ([rɔˈɫɐ̂ˑn̪d̪ɐs̪ ˈpäːk̪s̪ɐs̪] (13px ); born 10 June 1956) is a Lithuanian politician who was President of Lithuania from 2003 to 2004. He was previously Prime Minister of Lithuania in 1999 and again from 2000 to 2001, and he also served as Mayor of Vilnius from 1997 to 1999 and again from 2000 to 2001. He has led Order and Justice since 2004 and has been a Member of the European Parliament since 2009.A national aerobatics champion in the 1980s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Paksas founded a construction company, Restako. In 1997, he was elected to Vilnius City Council for the centre-right Homeland Union and became mayor. In May 1999, Paksas was appointed Prime Minister, but resigned five months later after a disagreement over privatisation. Paksas joined the Liberal Union of Lithuania (LLS) in 2000. The LLS won the 2000 election, and Paksas became PM again, but he left within seven months after another dispute over economic reforms.In 2002, Paksas founded the Liberal Democratic Party, and ran for the presidency, winning the run-off against incumbent Valdas Adamkus in January 2003. It emerged that he had granted citizenship to a major campaign donor, leading to his impeachment and removal from office in April 2004. He was the first European head of state to have been impeached. Barred from the Seimas, Paksas was elected to the European Parliament in 2009, while leading his party, now called Order and Justice (TT). His lifetime ban from the Seimas was ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights in 2011.",

    "abstract": "Nicholas John Griffin (born 1 March 1959) is a former chairman and later president of the far-right British National Party (BNP), until he was expelled from the party in October 2014. He represented North West England as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2009 to 2014.Born in Barnet, England, Griffin was educated at Woodbridge School in Suffolk. He joined the National Front at the age of fourteen and, following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, became a political worker for the party. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for several right-wing magazines. He was the National Front's candidate for the seat of Croydon North West in 1981 and 1983, but left the party in 1989.  In 1995 he joined the BNP and in 1999 became its leader. He stood as the party's candidate in several elections and became a member of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European elections.In 1998 Griffin was convicted of distributing material likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006 he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought to distance himself from some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.",

From October 2005 to November 2007 he was the Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General. He was elected to the Sejm on September 25, 2005 in the 13th Kraków district, running on the Law and Justice list. He received over 120,000 votes in the parliamentary election, the highest percentage constituency result on a nationwide scale.Ziobro graduated from the Faculty of Law and Administration of Jagiellonian University. He did not complete his PhD. He was a member of the Sejm from 2001-2005.Due to his proclaimed \"battle against corruption\", he became one of the more popular, but also polarizing, politicians in Poland. His uncompromising approach and publicized prosecutions earned him the title Man of the year 2006, awarded by Wprost magazine. However, some of his policies were repeatedly characterized as partisan and overzealous by local and international press, including The Economist.In 2007, former Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Janusz Kaczmarek, allegedly linked to the Andrzej Lepper bribery case, was forced to resign. He subsequently made a series of attack on members of the government, especially Ziobro. In a media confrontation with vice-PM Andrzej Lepper, Ziobro revealed that he had secretly recorded a conversation with Lepper.In the elections to the European Parliament in 2009, he was elected in the Kraków constituency as an MEP. He received 335 933 votes, representing the second highest score in the country.",

In the European Parliament she is member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee and Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee. Also member of the delegation to the relations with the Mashriq Countries, with the Legislative Council of Palestine and with South Africa.At the beginning of mandate was nominated the Parliament’s rapporteur to write and negotiate the directive preventing the entrance of false medicines into legal distribution. A business that generates more than € 400 billion per year for the counterfeiting networks and puts at risk the life of patients. The proposed directive, and negotiated for almost two years, with the parliamentary groups and the governments, would be approved in 2011. Marisa Matias was the second time since Portugal’s entrance at the EU a Portuguese MEP, which leaded the process of a framework-directive, a law that will be transposed to the judicial system of the each of the 28 member States until 2016. At the same time, she was also rapporteur of the European strategy in the fight against Alzheimer and other dementias, that would equally be approved in 2011. She was part, and co-president, of the European Work Group for Diabetes, being co-author of the first resolution to ever be approved in the European Parliament aiming at the definition of a political strategy to fight the diabetes epidemic (2010). Was also involved in the planning and approval of proposals of resolution on cancer, HIV, and was active member of the parliamentary committee inquiry on the case of H1N1 vaccine. In 2011 was elected by its pairs, with more than 350 votes, was MEP of the Year for health, being the single MEP from the United Left Parliamentary Group to receive this price since its creation.In the years 2011 and 2012 was the Parliament’s rapporteur for the definition of a Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation. The report was be approved in 2012 and established the bases for what should be the proposal for the Horizon 2020 Program on the European financing of research and innovation for the period 2014-2020. Besides the proposal to reinforce the funds and of a better geographical distribution of the funds, the approved proposal also included a significant increase of support to the scientific work and to the attribution of scholarships within the European financing framework. Later, would also be part of the team of six rapporteurs, nominated by the European Parliament, to the definition and negotiation of the proposal about the Horizon 2020, being responsible for one of the legislative regulations on the Strategic Agenda for Innovation. The legislative package would end up being approved at the end of 2013, being already active since January 2014.In 2012 she was still nominated rapporteur of the European Parliament for the evaluation of the European Central Bank (ECB) activities of 2011, the year the ECB presidency changed. In a very disputed process and hard negotiations, her report would be approved by one vote of difference in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Later, the report would be approved, in plenary, still in 2013, but Marisa Matias requested her name to be withdraw as a result of approved changes in the final vote. Those changed took out of the report all the critical references to the ECB as member of the Troika, equally eliminating the proposal to oblige the ECB to restore to the countries under the Troika’s intervention the profits resulting from the complex processes of buying and selling of public debt titles. Marisa Matias was, still, the Parliament’s rapporteur for four opinion on European strategy for adapting to climate change, resettling of GDP calculation, proposal for a new pluri-annual financing framework and regulation defining indexes on the goods traded in stock market.As shadow rapporteur, meaning, MEP responsible within its parliamentary group, to follow and negotiate proposals leaded by other colleagues from other parliamentary groups, Marisa Matias followed, during the mandate, the making of 25 parliamentary proposals, having presented proposals for change and being present in negotiation meetings. So far, was also co-author of 119 proposals of parliamentary resolutions.While Vice-President of the Parliament to the relations with the Mashriq countries (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt) was part and presided to several parliamentary negotiations with these countries, coordinating processes of negotiation with the correspondent national parliaments. This was also done during the period known for the transformations introduced by the Arab Spring. Marisa is also member of the Parliament’s Delegation to the relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, having developed initiatives mainly concerning the siege of the Gaza Strip.",

    "abstract": "Corneliu Vadim Tudor (Romanian pronunciation: [korˈnelju vaˈdim ˈtudor]; born 28 November 1949 in Bucharest) is the leader of the  Greater Romania Party (Partidul România Mare), poet, writer, journalist and a former Member of the European Parliament. He was a Romanian Senator from 1992 to 2008.A political figure, he is known for his strongly nationalist  views, which are reflected in his rhetoric and denunciation against political opponents (so far, a tactic which several civil lawsuits have ruled slanderous). He is most commonly referred to as \"Vadim\", many times understood as a family name (although it is clearly not shared with his relatively well-known brother, former Army officer and fellow Party member Marcu Tudor).A disciple of the writer Eugen Barbu (who was an unofficial trusted advisor to Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu), Tudor was energetic in his praise (in both prose and poetry) of the longtime communist dictator prior to Romania's 1989 revolution.",

A member of the Basque Nationalist Party, she was the President of the Basque Parliament in the 2005-2009 term, being elected to the office as a \"consensus candidate\" among the nationalist majority in the legislature when the incumbent President and initial candidate of her party, Juan María Atutxa, failed to obtain the majority and the election deadlocked. She has a degree in Law.In 2008, she was in the center of a controversy regarding the placement of the Spanish flag in the seat of the Basque Parliament: the Spanish Law on Flags requires that all public institutions place the Spanish flag on a prominent place wherever the regional or local flags fly. After years of not submitting to such law and flying only the Ikurriña (Basque flag), the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that the Basque Parliament would have to fly the Spanish flag too. In the Bureau meeting that studied the ruling, Izaskun Bilbao sided with the non-nationalist minority in the Parliament ruling body to actually place the flag against the official policy of her party. She defended this decision as simply obeying the final ruling of the Supreme Court, and thus having nothing to do with politics.",

The UMP won one seat in the constituency with 29.7% of the votes, and since the UMP obtained its highest result in the Pacific Section (44.4%), Ponga was elected to the European Parliament.
